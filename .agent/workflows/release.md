# Release Workflow

This workflow wraps the existing Codex prompt for Releases.

1.  **Read Instructions**: Read the comprehensive instructions in [release.prompt.md](file:///Users/fossum/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/Projects/biruks-egg-deliveries/.github/prompts/release.prompt.md).
2.  **Execute**: Follow the instructions for cutting releases, generating notes, and publishing.
