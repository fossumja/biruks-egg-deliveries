# Feature Delivery Workflow

This workflow wraps the existing Codex prompt for Feature Delivery.


1.  **Context**: Read `.planning/state.md` and `.planning/project.md` to align with the active phase and vision.
2.  **Read Instructions**: Read the comprehensive instructions in [feature.prompt.md](file:///Users/fossum/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/Projects/biruks-egg-deliveries/.github/prompts/feature.prompt.md).
3.  **Execute**: Follow the instructions and procedures defined in that file exactly.
    *   Use `action=start` to begin a feature.
    *   Use `action=next` to work on child issues.
    *   Use `action=finish` to complete the feature.
    *   Use `action=review` for PR review.
