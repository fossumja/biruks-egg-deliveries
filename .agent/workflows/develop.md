# Development Workflow

This workflow wraps the existing Codex prompt for the Development Lifecycle.


1.  **Context**: Read `.planning/state.md`.
2.  **Read Instructions**: Read the comprehensive instructions in [develop.prompt.md](file:///Users/fossum/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/Projects/biruks-egg-deliveries/.github/prompts/develop.prompt.md).
3.  **Execute**: Follow the instructions and procedures defined in that file regarding V-model delivery, issues, and feature branching.
