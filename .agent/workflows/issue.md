# Issue Management Workflow

This workflow wraps the existing Codex prompt for Issue Management.


1.  **Context**: Read `.planning/roadmap.md` and `.planning/state.md`.
2.  **Read Instructions**: Read the comprehensive instructions in [issues.prompt.md](file:///Users/fossum/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/Projects/biruks-egg-deliveries/.github/prompts/issues.prompt.md).
3.  **Execute**: Follow the instructions for triaging, refining, and breaking down issues.
