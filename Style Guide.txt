Biruk’s Egg Project Deliveries – Style Guide
This style guide defines a cohesive, iOS-inspired design system for the “Biruk’s Egg Project Deliveries” PWA. The design emphasizes clarity, simplicity, and native iPhone look-and-feel, ensuring the app feels at home on iOS while remaining a lightweight web implementation.
Overview & Design Philosophy
Biruk’s Egg Project Deliveries is a small offline-first utility app used daily in the field. The primary user (Biruk’s aunt) needs a clean, calm interface that’s easily readable in a car or at a doorstep. The design language is modern and minimalist, leaning on iOS conventions (system fonts, large titles, rounded cards) to feel familiar on an iPhone. Visual clutter is minimized in favor of high clarity and obvious primary actions. The app adopts iOS design cues – comfortable touch targets, safe area padding, subtle animations – so that using the PWA feels as seamless as a native app.
The guide below covers design foundations (layout, colors, typography, spacing, etc.), UI components, motion guidelines, theming tokens, and example layouts for key screens. It also highlights how to support the white logo and ensure the PWA respects iOS-specific behaviors. All recommendations are made with practicality in mind, so developers can implement them in Angular with CSS (or utilities like Tailwind) and achieve a consistent, user-friendly interface.

1. Foundations
   Layout & Breakpoints
   • Viewport & Content Width: Design for iPhone portrait widths ~320px (iPhone SE) up to ~430px (larger iPhones). The app uses a single-column layout that is centered within the viewport for widths above 320px. Set a maximum content width around 420px for readability on larger screens. This ensures the UI doesn’t stretch too wide on slightly larger devices.
   • App Shell Structure: Use a wrapping container (e.g. a div with class .app-shell) to center content and apply global padding. For example:
   <div class="app-shell">
     <header class="app-header">…</header>
     <main class="app-content">…</main>
     <footer class="app-footer">…</footer>
   </div>
    	The .app-shell can enforce a max-width (420px) and auto margin for centering on wider screens, and a base horizontal padding (e.g. 16px) so content isn’t against the screen edges.
   •	Spacing System: Adopt an 8px base grid for spacing and sizing. All margins, paddings, and gaps should be in increments of 8 (with 4px as a half-unit for fine adjustments). Common spacing values: 4, 8, 16, 24, 32px, etc. This yields consistent rhythm. For instance:
   •	Page side padding: 16px (2 units).
   •	Gaps between stacked elements: 8px or 12px depending on grouping.
   •	Section margins: 24px top/bottom to separate major sections.
   •	Safe Areas: On iPhones with notches or home indicators, ensure content is not hidden or hard to reach. The app’s header and any fixed footer should include padding to respect the safe area insets[1]. Use CSS environment variables for this:
    	.app-header { padding-top: env(safe-area-inset-top, 16px); }
   .app-footer { padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom, 16px); }
    	Generally, iPhones require ~44px top safe padding and ~34px bottom in portrait[1], so these values ensure the UI does not clash with the notch or home indicator. The env() fallback (16px here) provides padding on non-notch devices as well.
   •	Layout Regions:
   •	Header: Occupies top of screen, contains either the app title or logo. Fixed position if needed, with a height accommodating status bar (use safe-area padding). Typically ~56px tall plus safe area (so ~88-90px on notch devices including the 44px inset).
   •	Main Content: Scrollable area for lists, cards, forms, etc., centered with horizontal padding. Background a light gray to differentiate from white cards.
   •	Footer/Bottom Bar: Used on specific screens (e.g. Delivery Run) as a sticky action bar. Should be fixed to bottom, full-bleed width, with safe-area bottom padding. Height ~56px (to comfortably fit large buttons) plus bottom inset. Can optionally be translucent (see iOS style notes).
   Color System
   We use a simple, high-contrast palette with a friendly tone (inspired by eggs/farm warmth). All colors are chosen for readability in sunlight and compliance with at least WCAG AA contrast for text. Define the palette as CSS variables (design tokens) for easy theming:
   •	Background: --color-bg = #F3F4F6 – a soft, light gray for app background. This neutral canvas reduces glare and lets white cards stand out.
   •	Surface: --color-surface = #FFFFFF – pure white for cards and main surfaces. Use this for content cards, headers (if using a card style header), and any containers. White against the light gray background creates natural separation.
   •	Primary Text: --color-text = #111827 – nearly black (a dark gray) for high-legibility text[2]. This is used for all primary text on light backgrounds (titles, body text). It provides strong contrast on white (this color is roughly equivalent to an iOS default text color, which is typically black or near-black[2]).
   •	Secondary Text: --color-text-muted = #6B7280 – a medium gray for secondary information[3] (addresses, notes, labels). This color is around 60% opacity black, providing contrast while de-emphasizing less critical info. On white, it’s still readable but clearly lower hierarchy.
   •	Primary Accent: --color-primary = #F59E0B – a warm amber/golden tone as the brand accent (evoking egg yolk or sunshine). This is used for primary buttons (“Deliver”, “Start Route”) and highlights. It stands out against the neutral background without feeling harsh. On white text: Use white text on this amber for buttons to ensure contrast (Amber 500 on white is borderline for small text, so for large button text it should be acceptable; for any smaller text on amber, consider using the darker shade below or black text).
   •	Primary Accent Dark: --color-primary-dark = #D97706 – a darker amber (e.g. hover/pressed state for the primary button, or for use on lighter elements). For example, when a primary button is pressed, using this darker shade gives a clear visual feedback.
   •	Success (Secondary Accent): --color-success = #10B981 – a green to denote success or completed actions. This can be used for status indicators (e.g., a delivered status dot or success toast). It should be used sparingly (since the primary amber is already prominent). Ensure white or very dark text is used on any green background for contrast.
   •	Danger: --color-danger = #EF4444 – a red for errors or destructive actions. For example, an “Delete” action or a critical error toast. Use white text on red backgrounds. (This red is vibrant; consider slightly darker red for better contrast if used behind text).
   •	Neutral Border/Shadow: Not a standalone token, but use neutral grays (like #D1D5DB, a gray-300) for subtle borders or dividers between elements on white, to maintain separation without heavy lines.
   Usage & Contrast: Use the primary accent color for interactive highlights: primary buttons, selected states, focus rings, etc. All text placed on a colored background (amber, green, red) should be white for maximum contrast. Conversely, colored text on white (like a link or accent text) should be dark enough; in our palette, the amber (#F59E0B) on white is best used for larger UI elements or icons, not body text, because it has a contrast ratio around ~3:1 on white (which is below the 4.5:1 recommended for normal text). If using amber for smaller text (e.g. a colored label), pair it with a darker version or ensure the font weight/size is large enough to meet WCAG AA (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text). The provided --color-primary-dark can serve for small text on light background if needed, as it’s a bit more brownish and higher contrast.
   Also consider dark mode possibility: Since this is a PWA, you might add dark mode later. The system colors should invert (light bg to dark, etc.) if so. But initially, focus on a consistent light theme (with the above palette) to ensure outdoor readability.
   Typography System
   Use the iOS system font and a simple type scale for clarity on small screens. The type ramp is tuned to ensure text is large enough when needed (e.g. headings, critical data) and always legible. We’ll use Apple’s San Francisco (SF) font via the system font stack, which makes the web app instantly feel native and loads fast (no custom font files)[4].
   •	Font Family: Use the system-ui stack for Apple:

   font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
   This stack will use San Francisco on iOS (and fall back to the appropriate system font on other platforms)[5], creating a seamless look with native apps. The user’s device font settings (for Dynamic Type, etc.) can also influence this, which is good for accessibility.
   • Base Size: 16px (the default browser font size, equivalent to roughly 12pt on iOS). This is the baseline for body text. We will treat 16px as ~“body/regular text” size.
   • Scale: Build a typographic scale for different text levels. For example:
   • Large Title: ~32px (2rem) at Bold weight. Use this for the app’s main screen title or large headers (e.g., on the Home screen, “Deliveries” or the app name, if displayed). iOS convention uses 34pt for large titles[2], so ~32px gives a similar feel in web context.
   • Section Header: ~22px at Semibold weight. Use for section titles or screen titles in regular contexts (e.g., “Route Planner”, “Week A”). This stands out but is more modest than the huge large title.
   • Card Title / Important Text: ~18px (1.125rem) at Semibold. This is good for names of stops, or any primary info on a card. It’s comfortably readable at arm’s length and draws attention.
   • Body Text: 16px at Regular weight. For general content, descriptions, addresses, standard button text. This aligns with iOS default text size (17pt is default on iPhone[2], and 16px is a close web equivalent).
   • Secondary Text: 14-15px at Regular or Medium weight. For less important details like secondary labels, or note text. (15pt is used on iOS for secondary text[3]; we can use 14px which is a hair smaller but ensures good fit on narrow screens, or 15px if the font rendering allows it).
   • Caption/Minor: 12-13px at Regular weight. For captions, timestamps, or notes of very low emphasis. (iOS uses 13pt or sometimes 12pt for tertiary text[6]. We should avoid going below 12px for legibility.)
   • Button Text: Ideally match the body size (16px) or slightly larger (17-18px) if space allows, in Semibold weight. Buttons should have clear, large labels. iOS typically uses 17pt for button labels[7], so mirroring that (16-17px) ensures they are easy to read at a glance.
   • Tiny Labels (if needed, e.g. in an action bar or as a badge): Minimum ~10px, but this should be rare. (iOS tab bar icons/labels use around 10pt[8]. In our app, nearly everything can use larger text; avoid 10px except perhaps icon annotation, since the primary user benefits from larger text.)
   • Font Weights: Use a limited set of weights for clarity and performance:
   • Regular (400): for body text, paragraphs, longer content.
   • Medium/Semibold (500-600): for short, important text like headers, button labels, or data points that need emphasis. e.g., use semibold for “Stop Names”, section titles, or numbers of dozens so they stand out from labels.
   • Bold (700): for very prominent items (the app title or large title on a screen, or maybe the current stop’s name on the delivery card if maximum emphasis is needed). Bold should be used sparingly so it retains its impact. Often, Medium or Semibold will suffice for most headings in iOS style.
   • Line Heights: Keep line-height fairly tight for large text, but generous for body text to enhance readability:
   • Large titles/headings: ~1.1 line-height (slight extra spacing, but we want them to appear as distinct titles).
   • Body and secondary text: ~1.4 line-height (for 16px text, around 22px line-height). This improves legibility for paragraphs or multi-line addresses.
   • Captions: ~1.3 line-height (small text may need a little more spacing relative to its size to avoid looking cramped).
   • In CSS, you might set a global line-height: 1.4 for body and then override headings with specific tighter values as needed.
   • Truncation & Wrapping: Because the app will often display names and addresses, use utilities like text-overflow: ellipsis for single-line fields (e.g., a long customer name on a route list might truncate). Ensure important text (like the Stop name on the Delivery card) can wrap to two lines if needed, rather than shrink too small – clarity is more important than fitting everything on one line. For addresses, maybe wrap to two lines at most.
   By following this typography system (system font, proper sizing), the app’s text will feel native and be easily readable. As a reference, Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines use similar sizes (e.g. 17pt base text, 34pt large titles, 15pt secondary)[2], which we’ve tailored to our web app context.
   Spacing & Sizing
   Consistent spacing is key to a clean, scannable interface: - Base Unit: 8px. All spacing and component sizes should derive from this. This creates visual harmony and predictability. - Padding & Margin: Use multiples of 8px for structuring layouts: - Section top margins: ~24px (3 units) to clearly separate different sections or cards. - Vertical spacing between form fields or list items: 16px (2 units) for grouping related elements. - Small gaps (between label and a value, or icon and text): 4px or 8px depending on the context (4px if they should appear tightly related, 8px if a bit more breathing room is needed). - Card inner padding: 16px on all sides (gives content room to breathe within cards). - Modal or large container padding: could use 20-24px for a slightly more spacious feel. - Touch Target Size: Minimum 44px height (and width) for any tappable UI element[9]. This is an Apple guideline to ensure buttons are easy to hit. Our primary and secondary buttons should ideally be taller (around 48–52px) to be comfortably touchable. List items or smaller controls should also have at least 44px of clickable height even if the text/icon is smaller (use padding to achieve this). - Button Size: - Primary/Secondary buttons: Height ~52px (to feel substantial on modern iPhones). If space is tight (e.g., two buttons side by side), 48px is acceptable but do not go lower than 44px[9]. Width: usually full-width in a column layout (minus padding), especially for the primary actions on small screens. This not only provides a large hit area but also reduces cognitive load in deciding where to tap. - Icon-only controls (if any, like a small “edit” icon): should still be wrapped in a 44x44 clickable area minimum[9], even if the icon graphic is 20px. - Card and List Item Size: - Delivery Card: should expand to fit its content (likely quite tall to show all info and the large buttons). It can take up most of the viewport height but leave some margin so it’s not edge-to-edge vertically; for example, maybe have 16px margin top and bottom in the view for a floating feel. - List Items (Route Planner rows): each row height should be at least 56px, preferably 64px, to accommodate two lines of text (name + address) and an optional status or icon. Again, ensure padding inside such rows gives 44px of tappable height if the row itself is a link or reordering handle. - Iconography Size: If using icons (like a small icon inside a button or a status dot), size them at a legible size relative to text: - Icons accompanying text (e.g., a small download icon next to “Import CSV”): about 16–20px so they are easily recognizable but not overpowering the text. - Standalone icons (like a drag handle or a status indicator dot): 24px container for something like a drag handle (with the icon maybe 16px inside), or a dot of ~12px radius for status (with proper accessible label). - Corner Radii: Use rounded corners generously to align with iOS aesthetics: - Card corners: ~12px radius. This gives cards a friendly, modern shape (iOS cards and panels often have 10-12pt radii for grouping content). - Button corners: 12px radius for a noticeable roundness (or even more for very pill-like appearance). The primary and secondary buttons can be moderately rounded (not full pills, unless desired; 12px on a ~52px tall button looks nicely rounded). For a very iOS look, you could use fully pill-shaped for main action buttons (e.g., 26px radius on a 52px tall button) – but that might feel more like older iOS. A 12px radius is a good balance for a modern touch. - Small elements (input fields, toast pills): 8px radius. Input fields should have some rounding for approachability. Toast notifications can be pill-shaped (huge radius relative to height) to differentiate from regular rectangles. - Modal or large panels (if any): could consider slightly larger radius (maybe 16px) if they appear over the background, to really feel like separate layers. - Elevation & Shadows: The design should be mostly flat with subtle depth: - Cards: Use a light shadow to lift white cards off the gray background just a bit. For example: box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1) on cards. This mimics the slight elevation of iOS cards and makes them distinguishable from the background without harsh outlines. Optionally, also add a very light border (1px solid #E5E7EB which is a light gray) on card edges to define them crisply (this is especially useful on devices with lower contrast displays or bright light). - Buttons: Generally, keep buttons flat (no heavy shadows) for a modern look. Instead of shadows, use color and contrast to make them stand out. The primary amber button doesn’t need a shadow; its bright color on neutral background is enough. However, for iOS fidelity, focus or active states can use inner shadows or slight outer shadows: - On press, you might inset a shadow to simulate the button being pressed (like inset 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.2)). - Or simply darken the background color for the pressed state (discussed later in interactions). - Navigation Bar / Footer bar: If using a translucent background, no drop shadow needed (the blur effect will differentiate it). If using a solid color, a subtle bottom shadow under the header (0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.1)) can separate it from content. But often just a different background color or border line is used instead of shadow. - No “Material” elevation tiers: Avoid large, multi-layer shadows or extreme elevation differences; these feel out of place on iOS which prefers subtlety. Depth should be just enough to indicate grouping or an overlay (like a modal could have a backdrop blur and a slightly stronger shadow, e.g. 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.2)).
   Iconography & Imagery
   • Icon Style: If icons are used, choose a style that matches the iOS aesthetic – typically thin outline icons (similar to Apple’s SF Symbols or iOS tab bar icons) or simple filled icons with rounded corners. Ensure consistency in weight and size. For example, using a set like Heroicons (outline style) or Feather icons can work; they are minimalist and have a unified look.
   • Usage: Use icons sparingly and primarily as aids (with labels) rather than standalone. For a non-tech-savvy user, text labels are crucial. Possible icon uses:
   • A download/import icon next to “Import CSV” (to reinforce that it’s about bringing in data).
   • A backup icon next to “Backup now”.
   • Status dots or symbols in the route list (e.g., a checkmark or a colored dot for delivered, a different symbol or color for skipped).
   • A reorder handle icon (≡ or drag grip) on the route planner list items if manual sorting is allowed.
   • Basic navigation or action icons if needed (like a back arrow if implementing a custom back button in the UI, or a settings gear if a settings screen exists).
   • Icon Color: Match icon color to text color in that context. E.g., icons in a primary button can be white (if any), icons next to text can be the same color as the text (primary or muted). This ensures a harmonious, monochromatic look rather than a rainbow of icon colors.
   • Size & Touch: An icon should never be the only thing to tap if it’s small – always pad its tap area. For example, a small close “X” icon in a corner should be wrapped in a 44x44 clickable area or given padding so the user can easily hit it. If an icon is purely decorative and not interactive, consider whether it’s needed at all (keep the UI clean).
   • Images: The app likely won’t use many images except the logos. If any images are shown (perhaps a background illustration or something), ensure they are optimized and do not distract from functionality. Given the utility nature, probably skip decorative images to maintain quick loading (especially offline) and focus.
   Safe Area & Platform Adaptiveness
   Being a standalone PWA on iPhone, the app must handle screen cutouts: - Always account for the notch and home indicator. Use padding-top: env(safe-area-inset-top) on any fixed header and padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom) on any fixed footer[1]. This way, content is never hidden under the iOS status bar or home gesture area. - If using absolute-positioned elements (like a floating toast message at the bottom), also consider safe-area. For example, a toast might need bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom) + 16px to sit just above the home indicator comfortably. - Test on devices like iPhone X/11/12/13 where notch and bottom inset exist. Also ensure it still looks fine on older iPhones without a notch (the env variables will be zero, so the additional padding just becomes the fallback value, e.g. 16px). - Orientation: The app is primarily portrait. We don’t specifically design for landscape (since usage is in-hand quickly). But it should not break if accidentally rotated: content can center with perhaps more side margins. The safe area in landscape is different (more on sides), but since our layout is centered with padding, it should be inherently handled (just ensure maybe .app-shell { padding-left: env(safe-area-inset-left); padding-right: env(safe-area-inset-right); } if you want to be thorough). - No Fixed VH issues: iOS Safari has quirks with 100vh. To avoid content jumping when address bar shows/hides, consider using min-height: 100% on .app-shell combined with height: 100% on html/body, rather than 100vh, or use the JS workaround for fullheight if needed. This is a technical note beyond pure styling, but helps avoid layout bugs on iOS web.
   By laying these foundations (grid, typography, color, spacing, safe areas), we ensure a robust base that looks consistent and functions well under the app’s constraints (small screen, offline use, sunlight readability, etc.). Next, we detail key components built on these foundations.

2. Components
This section describes the main UI components and patterns in the app, including their styles, states, and recommended structure. Each component description ties back to the foundations (colors, type, spacing) to ensure consistency.
App Shell & Header
The app shell includes the top header bar which remains consistent across screens: - Header Style: Use a simple top bar that contains either the app logo and title, or just a title. Two possible approaches: 1. Logo + Title on white: A light header bar (white background) with the app’s white logo placed on a colored badge so it’s visible, plus the app name. However, since the logo itself is white, this approach likely needs a colored background behind the logo mark. 2. Colored Header: A solid brand-colored background (perhaps the primary amber or a variant) with the white logo and maybe title text in white. This gives strong branding and makes the white logo pop.
Given the app is a utility, a minimal header might be best: possibly just a colored square with the logo at the left and the title text. Or, since the app has a full title “Biruk’s Egg Project Deliveries” which is long, you might opt to show just “Deliveries” as a large title on the home screen, and in other screens use a smaller header title. - Large Title on Home: On the Home/Dashboard, to embrace iOS style, you can use a Large Title style. For example, below the header (or as part of the header) display “Deliveries” in a large bold font (32-34px) when the view is scrolled to top[2]. This mirrors iOS apps that have large titles in the nav bar which shrink on scroll. In our case, since content isn’t scroll-heavy on home, it can just remain large. - Header Height & Safe Area: The top bar should be at least 44px tall excluding safe area, to meet the minimum tappable area (if the header contains any buttons like a back arrow or menu). Including the safe-area notch padding, total top space might be ~88px as noted. Use padding inside the header (e.g., 16px left/right) for spacing content away from edges. If the header is purely decorative on Home (no interactive elements except maybe the week toggle which could be below it), you could even allow more breathing room. - Content Alignment: Typically, left-align any logo/title in the header for iOS apps (large titles are usually left-aligned when not scrolled[10]). If you include a logo mark, you might put it to the left of the title text, or have the title as just text without logo. For example:
<header class="app-header" style="background: #F59E0B; color: #FFF;">
  <div class="header-content">
    <img src="logo-white.png" alt="" class="logo-icon" />
    <h1 class="app-title">Deliveries</h1>
  </div>
</header>
In CSS, .header-content { display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 8px; padding: 0 16px; } to space the logo and title. - Translucency (Optional): For a more iOS feel, you could make the header translucent with a blur. For example, background: rgba(255,255,255,0.8); backdrop-filter: blur(10px); on the header. This would give that iOS UINavigationBar effect (especially if the background content scrolls underneath). However, this might be overkill if your header is simple. It also requires care with dark text on translucent background (ensure contrast with whatever might be behind). Alternatively, a solid color header is perfectly fine and simpler. - Back Button: Since this is a single-page style PWA, we might implement in-app navigation. If a back button is needed (for example, from the Route Planner back to Home, or simply rely on iOS swipe-from-left gesture if it works in PWA), design a simple back arrow icon at the left of the header when appropriate. Use the iOS-style chevron (“<”) with the label “Back” or the previous screen title if possible. Size it ~24px icon plus text. Make sure its hit area is large (44px square). - Week Toggle (UI specific): The home screen needs a Week selector (“Week A” / “Week B”). This could be a segmented control or a toggle button: - A segmented control style: Two buttons side by side, each 50% width of its container, one active (highlighted). iOS segmented controls typically are pill-shaped containers with one segment filled. We can emulate this: e.g., a small group with border radius 8px, a slight border. The active week has background: #F59E0B; color: #fff (primary color background), the inactive has transparent background or light gray and primary color text. Tapping one toggles. Use at least 44px height for each segment. This control can sit in the header or just below it. - Alternatively, a simpler UI is just a text label or dropdown that indicates the current schedule (but a toggle is more direct). - Status Bar Style: If using a colored header (like amber), ensure the PWA’s meta theme-color is set appropriately so the iOS status bar text is legible (iOS will use either light or dark status bar depending on background brightness). For example, with a bright amber header, you might want status bar text black (so choose a light theme color if amber is light enough), but if amber is dark or you go with a dark nav bar, then status bar text white.
In summary, the app header should be simple, visibly separate from content (via color or slight shadow), and include branding in a subtle way. On child screens (like during the route), you might opt for a minimal header (or none at all) to maximize content space, using a back gesture or a small top bar with just a back button and small title.
Cards (Content Containers)
Most information in the app is presented on cards – distinct panels with a white background and rounded corners, floating on the light gray page. - General Card Style: White background (--color-surface), 12px corner radius, subtle shadow/border as discussed. Cards have 16px inner padding. They should stretch the full width of the content column (minus margins). On small screens, that effectively means nearly full width with 16px side padding inside is enough. - Delivery Card (Stop Detail Card): This is the centerpiece on the Delivery Run screen, showing the current stop’s info: - Structure: It should display a hierarchy of info: - Top meta: “Stop X of N” label and the progress indicator (bar). This could be a small strip at the very top of the card or just above it. The “Stop X of N” could be a caption (small, muted text) aligned maybe center or left. The progress bar could sit directly below it spanning the card’s width. - Primary info: The Stop Name or Business – this should be prominent (e.g., 18px Semibold or larger) and maybe on its own line if long. If a stop name is short, can maybe include city on same line separated by a bullet or dash; but better to put address separately. - Address: A second line (or two lines) of address: likely smaller (14-16px regular) and muted. Possibly format as “City, ST ZIP” on one line below name, with the street address either combined or on another line above it, depending on how addresses are stored. Clarity is key; maybe:
[Name/Org]
1234 Oak Street, Springfield, SD 57000
If the name itself is descriptive enough, you can shorten address to city, but since deliveries might need address shown for navigation, include at least street + city. - Quantity of Dozens: This is critical info (how many egg dozens to deliver). Make this big and bold. For example, “5 dozen” could be a large text element, maybe styled like a badge or just text with strong weight. Placing it prominently helps ensure no mistakes at delivery. One idea: put it on the right side of the card in large text, or inline with the name (though if name is long, better separate). Another approach: have a dedicated row like: - Label “Eggs” or an egg icon, then “5 dozen” in large font. But since all entries are eggs, you could just show “5 dozen” boldly and perhaps the word “dozen” smaller. Choose a style that’s instantly noticeable (e.g., 20px bold for the number, with the unit). - Notes: If there are optional notes for a stop, include them in a subdued way. Possibly a slightly smaller font (14px, muted color) in italic or prefixed with “Note:”. Ensure this doesn’t overpower the main info. Maybe give it its own small paragraph or a smaller section at bottom of card if present. - Visual Emphasis: Use font size and weight to establish a clear hierarchy. The stop name and quantity are high-emphasis; address and notes are secondary. You can also use color: main text in primary text color, notes in --color-text-muted. - Status Indicator: If re-visiting a stop card that was delivered or skipped, you might show an indicator on the card (like a colored corner or a small badge “Delivered”). However, since in the run sequence you typically only see the current stop, you might not need an explicit label on the card itself except if user swipes back to a previous stop. Could implement a tiny text in the top meta (“Delivered” or “Skipped”) if viewing an already-settled stop. - List Item Cards (Route Planner rows): On the route planning screen, you have a list of stops possibly in a reorderable list. - These can be designed as list rows rather than full “cards” to use space efficiently. For instance, each item can be a full-width white rectangle touching the edges of the content column (with maybe 8px spacing between items). They can have slightly smaller corner radius (say 8px) or even no radius on top/bottom if they form a continuous list group, though a bit of radius and spacing helps it look modern and not like an old table. - Use a simple two-line layout: - Line 1: Name/Business (16px Semibold) and perhaps the City (14px regular, muted) either next to the name or on line 2. If the name is short, you can do something like Name – City on one line, but if name is long, break to two lines. - Line 2: Perhaps City, ST (if not on line 1) and the quantity dozens. You could right-align the quantity on this line to the far right for consistency, or make a small badge. For example:
Biruk's Market – Sioux Falls, SD    [icon] 5 dz
where [icon] could be a small egg icon or just text "5 dz" with a bold number. - If a stop is marked delivered/skipped in this list (after the run, or if viewing planned vs completed), you could include a status tag: e.g., a small green dot or check for delivered, a red slash or icon for skipped. These could appear at the end of the line or as a colored left border on the item. - Drag Handle: If reordering is allowed, include a drag handle on the right or left. A common pattern is three stacked horizontal lines (like ≡). Place it on the far right, and ensure the item still has 44px padding so grabbing it is easy. Possibly only show the handle in edit mode or on hover (but since mobile has no hover, maybe always show it faintly). - Interactive States: Each list item might be tappable (to view/edit details or to start navigation). If so, use an active highlight on press (iOS lists typically flash a light gray on tap). Implement by adding a CSS :active style of background: #E5E7EB (light gray) or similar on the list item. Remove default tap highlight color (-webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent;) and handle the active feedback manually for consistent look. - Other Cards: The Home screen might have small summary cards or sections: - “Route Summary” with total stops, delivered, skipped counts could be presented as a small info card. For example, a row of three stats: each stat in a small card with a subtle background. Or simply text lines. E.g., “Total stops: 12, Delivered: 10, Skipped: 2” could just be one line of text with bold numbers. - If using cards, maybe have one card with a light background color (like a very pale amber or gray) for this summary, to set it apart, but that might break consistency. Alternatively, keep it white and rely on text hierarchy. - Form Fields as Cards: If the app has forms (like an import CSV maybe triggers file input, or backup might have options), style form fields minimally. Use native iOS form controls when possible (they’ll use native styles). If customizing, ensure inputs have 44px height, 8px radius, 1px border of #D1D5DB, and 8px padding. On focus, border could highlight (perhaps in the primary amber or a blue default outline). Keep forms simple and few.
In general, cards group content and provide a touch-friendly surface. All cards and list items should maintain the spacing and sizes described (padding, min height) so they feel airy and easy to tap. Use the consistent white surface style to make information blocks clear against the app’s gray background.
Buttons
We have three tiers of buttons: Primary (high emphasis), Secondary (medium emphasis), Tertiary (low-emphasis or text-only). All buttons use our color system and spacing for consistency.
•	Primary Buttons: These drive the main actions (e.g. “Deliver”, “Start route”).
•	Style: Filled with the primary accent color (--color-primary amber). Text color white. Bold or semibold text, 16-18px size. Full-width on small screen when alone in a column. Padding: 12px vertical (making ~48-52px tall with text size) and 16px horizontal (but full-width buttons will just have equal padding and stretch).
•	Shape: Rounded corners (12px radius). If two primary buttons are side by side (rare in our app – more likely we have primary + secondary side by side for Deliver/Skip), ensure there’s a gap (8px) and maybe each takes up 50% width.
•	States:
o	Default: Amber background, white text.
o	Hover: (on desktop perhaps) slightly darker amber (--color-primary-dark) or an opacity change.
o	Active/Pressed: Use the darker amber (--color-primary-dark) as background and perhaps push down 1px or use an inset shadow to show depth. The press feedback should be quick and then return to default when released.
o	Disabled: If a primary action can be disabled (e.g., “Start route” when no data), style it as a gray filled button or reduce opacity (~50%). E.g., background #D1D5DB (gray-300) and text #9CA3AF (gray-400) or white with 50% opacity. Ensure it still meets contrast (or simply don’t show the button at all if it cannot be used).
•	Examples: “Deliver” button on the delivery card is primary — bright amber to encourage tapping it when the delivery is done. “Start Route” on home is primary.
•	Secondary Buttons: These are less prominent actions, often alongside a primary.
•	Style: Either an outline or a tonal button. For iOS-like design, a common style is a simple outline or a softer color fill.
o	For example, the “Skip” button could be a white button with an amber border (1.5px solid --color-primary) and amber text. That way it’s clearly secondary to the solid amber “Deliver”.
o	Alternatively, use a light fill like rgba(245,158,11,0.1) (amber at 10% opacity) for the background and amber text, no border. This gives a “tonal” look (color is present but subtle).
•	Same padding and radius as primary (so it’s equally large). This ensures the tap area is big.
•	States:
o	Default: Outline visible or light fill.
o	Hover/Active: If outline style, maybe fill with a very light amber on press to indicate interaction. If tonal style, darken the background a bit on press (e.g., amber 20%).
o	Disabled: Similar treatment as primary (gray out). Possibly a gray border and gray text if outlined, or just make it look like a disabled link.
•	Usage: “Skip” is a secondary action on the Delivery screen. On Home, “Backup now” might be a secondary button (which could simply be styled as an outline since it’s not the main CTA).
•	Secondary buttons can also be used for less critical actions like “Cancel” in a dialog or “Import CSV” if that’s not primary.
•	Tertiary Buttons: These are text-only clickable items or very low emphasis (like links or minor actions).
•	Style: Flat text with perhaps an underlined or a subtle hover. Color them with the primary color for visibility if they need to stand out (e.g., a “Edit” link could be amber text). Or if it’s a destructive action like “Delete route”, use the danger red for the text.
•	Font: Same base font (16px) but can be regular weight since they’re not as crucial. Possibly add an icon if needed to clarify (like a small “chevron” for something like “View details >”).
•	Touch Area: Even though visually just text, wrap it in a larger tap target (padding around it or use block-level).
•	Example: a “Last backup: 2 days ago – Backup now” scenario might have “Backup now” as a tertiary link style next to text, but better to make it a secondary button to ensure clarity. A tertiary could be a subtle “Undo” action on a toast, for instance.
•	Button Placement:
•	For forms or dialogs, primary on the right, secondary on the left (following iOS dialog order). But in our app, on the Delivery card, we likely place primary and secondary side by side full-width at bottom (stacked in a row). On small screens, two full-width buttons stack vertically by default; but you can also place them in a horizontal flex so they each take 50% width. Decide based on space: if labels are short (“Deliver”, “Skip”), a horizontal split is fine and keeps the card shorter.
•	On the Home screen, primary “Start route” might be followed by a secondary “Import CSV” above or below. If vertically stacked, give 16px space between.
•	Global Button Styles (CSS): Define base styles:
 	.btn { font: 500 16px/1 -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, sans-serif; border-radius: 12px; padding: 12px 16px; display: inline-block; text-align: center; }
.btn-primary { background: var(--color-primary); color: #fff; border: none; }
.btn-primary:active { background: var(--color-primary-dark); }
.btn-secondary { background: #fff; color: var(--color-primary); border: 2px solid var(--color-primary); }
.btn-secondary:active { background: rgba(245,158,11,0.1); }
.btn-text { background: transparent; color: var(--color-primary); padding: 8px; border: none; }
.btn-text:active { opacity: 0.7; }
 	(This pseudocode illustrates the idea: primary filled, secondary outlined, text transparent. You would refine it and handle disabled states etc.)
•	Focus States: Although primarily a touch app, if any button is focused (via keyboard or VoiceOver accessibility), give it a clear focus outline. Typically, use a ring outline 2px in a high contrast color (often the system blue or our amber). For example, .btn:focus { outline: 2px solid #2563EB; outline-offset: 2px; } (or use CSS :focus-visible to only show for keyboard navigation).
By keeping buttons large, well-contrasted, and using familiar styling (filled vs outline) the user can quickly distinguish primary actions from secondary ones. The consistent rounded shape and spacing ties them into the overall design language.
Form Controls
The app is light on forms, but includes elements like dropdowns (week selector), file pickers (CSV import), and possibly text fields (if adding new stops or settings). Aim to use native iOS look where possible: - Dropdowns / Selects: Use the native <select> for simplicity – in iOS Safari, it will show a native picker control which is user-friendly. Style the <select> element to match the app: give it 44px height, full width, 8px padding, and radius 8px. For example:
select { font: 16px -apple-system, sans-serif; padding: 8px; border: 1px solid #D1D5DB; border-radius: 8px; background: #FFF url('data:image/svg+xml,...') no-repeat right 10px center; }
(Including a small chevron icon to indicate dropdown, using a data URI or so, or an SVG background aligned to the right). Ensure the text color is --color-text. On focus, maybe outline or border in amber. - Text Inputs: If needed, style similarly: border 1px solid #D1D5DB, 8px radius, padding 8px. Use color-scheme: light dark; on the input or globally to let iOS auto-adjust the text edit controls for dark mode if needed. Keep placeholders in --color-text-muted. - Labels: If you have form fields with labels, use a slightly smaller or medium weight text for labels (14px, medium, text-muted color). Place them above the field with a few pixels margin (4px). - Buttons as file inputs: For the CSV import, since that might actually be a file input control, it’s common to hide the raw input and use a styled button: - e.g., <input type="file" id="csvInput" hidden> and <button class="btn-secondary" onclick="csvInput.click()">Import CSV</button>. This way the UI looks like a normal button and triggers the file picker. - Toggles: If needed (maybe a toggle in settings), you can either use the native <input type="checkbox"> which on iOS will appear as a tiny checkbox (not ideal), or better, style a custom toggle. A custom toggle (slider) could be made but might be overkill. Simpler: use a checkbox but increase its size via CSS transform scale or use a custom graphic. Given minimal needs, native is fine. - Date pickers or Time pickers: If planning future deliveries, can rely on native <input type="date"> which on iOS triggers the native date picker wheel. Keep these default for familiarity.
The main principle is to leverage native controls for their built-in familiarity and offline reliability, while styling them lightly to match the overall design (font, spacing). Always ensure they’re big enough to tap and labels are clear.
Lists (Route Planner List)
We touched on this in Cards, but to reiterate key points for the route list screen: - It’s essentially a scrollable list of stops (likely in a <ul> or <ion-list> style if it were Ionic, but here we do our own). - Each item (stop) is either a card or a row. We opt for a row style: - Full-width white row, 8px corner radius, 8px vertical margin (or 4px if you want tighter). - Padding inside: 12px top/bottom (ensures >44px height even if text is one line) and 16px left/right. - Use flexbox to layout: e.g., .route-item { display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: space-between; }. Within it: - A left-aligned text block (stop name & city), and - a right-aligned block for the quantity and/or status. - Text styling: Stop name in bold or medium (perhaps 16px), city in normal 14px with muted color. You can stack them:
<div class="stop-info">
  <div class="stop-name">Alice’s Diner</div>
  <div class="stop-address">Sioux Falls, SD</div>
</div>
<div class="stop-qty">3 dozen</div>
The address/city line uses muted text. The quantity on right could be in the same style as body text but maybe medium weight to stand out (or even an amber colored badge to indicate pending deliveries). - Status indicator: If needed, incorporate an icon or color: - Option 1: a small dot before the stop name: green for delivered, red for skipped, gray for not done. This gives a quick visual, but might clutter the list. - Option 2: a word badge at the end (e.g., a green pill with “Done” or a red “Skipped”). This is explicit but takes more space. - Option 3: simply use the quantity text style: if delivered, show “✓” or strike-through or change the color. Perhaps simplest: if delivered, you could style the whole item differently (e.g., delivered stops appear with a lighter text or an italic). - Given this is a planning screen (likely before delivery), statuses might not apply yet. After finishing, the route planner could be used to see what was done. - Interactivity: Tapping a stop might allow editing or focusing it (unless reordering is the main function here). If you allow tap-to-edit, highlight as previously mentioned (light gray on press). - Sorting controls: You might have a control to sort by name/city. That could be a segmented control or a popover. Keep it simple: maybe a button “Sort by: City” that toggles to “Sort by: Name” if clicked, or a small menu. Place such control at top of list, right aligned. Style as a small secondary button or icon (like up/down arrows). - Scrolling: Make sure the list content doesn’t hide behind any fixed header; add top padding in the scroll container equal to header height (or use the header’s height naturally). And if using a bottom bar in that screen (not likely on planner screen), ensure the list bottom has padding so last item isn’t hidden.
Overall, the list should allow quick scanning – large text for stop names, consistent placement for quantities, and not too much visual noise. The use of whitespace and maybe subtle separators (you could add a 1px border-bottom #F0F0F0 on each item to create subtle dividing lines that visually align with the spacing) can help delineate items without heavy lines.
Bottom Action Bar
On the Delivery Run screen, once the route is started, it’s useful to have the Deliver and Skip actions reachable at the bottom, near the thumb’s reach. - Design: A fixed bottom bar that contains the two big buttons side by side. This bar appears on the Delivery Run screen (when actively going through stops). It should stick to the bottom of the app (position: fixed bottom 0). - Style: Possibly a slight translucent blurred panel, so it feels like an iOS tab bar: - Use a semi-transparent white (or light amber) background with backdrop-filter: blur(10px) to blur content under it. Example CSS:
.bottom-bar {
  position: fixed; bottom: 0; width: 100%;
  background: rgba(255,255,255,0.9);
  backdrop-filter: blur(20px);
  padding: 8px env(safe-area-inset-bottom) 8px 8px; /* top & bottom padding */
  display: flex; gap: 8px;
}
This will create a frosted effect. Place the two buttons inside as 50% width each. - If blur is not desired, a solid white or a very light gray background can be used, with a top border (1px #E5E7EB) to separate from content above. - Safe Area: As noted, include padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom) so that on iPhones with a home indicator, the bar’s content sits above it. The bar’s height should be at least 56px + safe area. - Button Layout: Likely two .btn elements inside. You might reduce their vertical padding a bit since the bottom bar already has some padding, but ensure they still end up 44px+ tall. If using full blur and white, primary button can still be amber (we might not want a translucent amber, so just make it the normal solid amber button). - Alternate Approach: Instead of a bottom bar with separate buttons, some apps make the entire bottom bar a big tappable area (like swipe up, etc.). But here we have two actions, so keep distinct buttons. - Transitions: When moving between stops, if you transition the main card content, the bottom bar remains fixed (only its button labels might change if context changes, but likely they remain “Deliver” and “Skip” throughout). This consistency helps muscle memory. - Other Screens: The bottom bar is not needed on the Home or Planner screens, so hide it there. Only present it during the actual delivery run.
By using a bottom action bar, we bring the critical actions closer to the thumb zone – critical for one-handed use. The slight translucency and safe area adherence ensure it looks like a natural extension of the iPhone interface (similar to a toolbar or tab bar).
Progress Indicators
The app has a notion of progress through a route (N stops total). We implement a simple, clear progress indicator: - Progress Bar: A horizontal bar showing how many stops have been completed. - Place it either at the very top of the Delivery card or just above the card’s header. Perhaps a thin bar (4px tall, full width of card minus padding). - Style: use a neutral light gray track (#E5E7EB) and a filled portion in our primary color (amber) or success color (green could indicate completed portion). Amber is fine to keep branding consistent, or green to indicate progress (since green often means done). - Animate the filled width when progress changes. For example, if going from stop 3 to 4 out of 10, increase the bar from 30% to 40% width with a smooth animation (200ms ease-out). - You can also display the numeric progress as text: we already have “Stop X of N” text, which suffices. The bar is just a visual cue. - Loading Indicators: If any action takes time (like importing CSV, or performing a backup), use a small spinner or activity indicator. Since the app is simple, you can use the native iOS-style spinner via CSS (<ion-icon name="spinner"> if ionic, or an SVG/CSS animation). - Keep it subtle and non-blocking. E.g., on a button that triggers backup, you could swap the text to a spinner icon and “Backing up…” text. - For offline/online status (if needed), a small spinner or icon in the header could show syncing, etc., but optional. - Toast/Feedback Indicator: Not exactly “progress” but ephemeral feedback. We’ll detail in Toasts.
The progress bar gives a quick sense of accomplishment and how far is left, which is good for user motivation. By keeping it minimal and at the top, it doesn’t distract but is easily noticed.
Toasts & Notifications
For brief feedback like “Marked as delivered” or “Backup completed”, implement a small toast: - Style: An overlay, near the bottom of the screen, above the bottom action bar (or above bottom safe area if no bar). Common iOS approach for in-app notifications (Banner style) is top, but since our focus is bottom actions and the user’s eyes are there, bottom is fine. We can mimic something like the old iOS “volume HUD” or a little banner: - Use a semi-transparent black or dark gray background with rounded corners (pill shape). For example: background: rgba(0,0,0,0.7), text color: #fff. - Padding: 8px 16px. - Font: 14px, medium weight perhaps. Keep it short text. - Radius: 999px (pill) or at least 16px for a rounded look. - The toast should be small enough to not require a dismiss; it’ll auto-hide. - Positioning: Fixed position, centered horizontally or slightly above bottom center. For example, bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom) + 64px (so it appears just above the bottom bar or where the home indicator is, roughly). Center it with left/right 50% transform, or simply text-align center on a container. - Animation: Use a slide and fade: - Initially, translateY(100%) to be offscreen (or scale from 0.9 and transparent). - On show, animate into place (translateY(0), opacity 1) over ~300ms with ease-out. - Let it stay for ~2 seconds, then animate out (maybe translateY(100%)+fade out). - Or slide down if at top. But bottom suits one-handed use. - Examples of messages: “✓ Marked delivered” after tapping Deliver. “Skipped” confirmation after Skip. “Route data backed up” after backup. Keep messages very brief and possibly include an icon like a small checkmark for success. - Multiple toasts: Ideally, show one at a time. If many actions in sequence, queue them. - No manual dismiss needed, they auto-fade, but allow interaction to dismiss by tapping if you want (just clear it on tap).
Toasts provide reassurance that an action succeeded (especially in offline context, it confirms to user that their tap was registered). By keeping them subtle and short-lived, they won’t require extra action from the user and won’t clutter the UI.

With these components defined, the app’s UI elements can be built consistently. Next, we’ll illustrate how these pieces come together on key screens. 3. Motion & Interaction Guidelines
Motion in this app should be subtle and supportive, following iOS conventions. We want to add polish (so the app doesn’t feel static) but without distracting or causing motion sickness. Key principles: - Use Short, Ease-out Animations: Keep animation durations around 200–300ms for most interactions. iOS animations tend to feel quick and ease-out (fast in the beginning, slowing at end). A standard easing curve like cubic-bezier(0.25,0.1,0.25,1) or simply ease-out works well for moving elements, giving a smooth but quick feel. - Screen Transitions: When navigating between screens (e.g., Home -> Route Planner -> Delivery Run), mimic native transitions: - Use a slide-in from the right for forward navigation if you implement multi-screen routing, and slide-out to right for back navigation (this mirrors iOS push/pop navigation). - Angular can handle route transitions; you can add CSS classes or use Angular animations to slide the new screen in. Duration ~300ms. - If not implementing that, at least ensure content changes aren’t abrupt: fade in new content quickly. - Delivery Card Transition (Next Stop): The core repeated transition is moving from one stop to the next. - When the user taps “Deliver” or “Skip”, you can animate the current card out and the new card in. For example, animate the current card upward and fade out (as if it moves up off the screen) while the next card enters from below. - You might slide the new card up 20px from below with opacity 0, to position, while the old card moves up 20px and fades to 0. Both happening in ~250ms gives a smooth swap. - Alternatively, a swipe gesture could be allowed (swipe left for skip, right for delivered) – but that may conflict with page navigation gestures on iOS. It might be simpler to stick to button triggers. - Provide a slight delay or staggering: maybe start new card entrance 50ms after old card starts exiting, to make it feel natural. - Button Feedback: For taps on buttons (Deliver, Skip, etc.): - Implement a quick tap-down effect: On touch start, slightly scale down the button to 97% and darken its background (for example, apply transform: scale(0.97) and if primary, use the darker amber as background)[11]. Remove this on touch end (release). - This gives a nice tactile feeling. The scale-down should be immediate (or with a 50ms ease-out to soften). - If using an outline button, you can instead slightly reduce opacity or change background to a light gray on tap. - Use :active CSS pseudo-class for simplicity (with the trick to enable :active in Safari by a touchstart listener, as needed). This ensures the pressed state shows even if the click triggers a route change (you might not see it long, but a brief flash is good). - Toast Animations: as described, slide/fade them. For example:
.toast-enter { transform: translateY(20px); opacity: 0; }
.toast-enter-active { transform: translateY(0); opacity: 1; transition: transform 300ms ease, opacity 300ms ease; }
.toast-exit-active { transform: translateY(20px); opacity: 0; transition: transform 300ms ease, opacity 300ms ease; }
This assumes adding/removing a toast element triggers these classes. - Progress Bar Animation: Animate the width change of the progress fill when moving to next stop: - Use CSS transition on width (ease-out, 300ms). This will smoothly grow the bar. You might also animate the label “Stop X of N” by incrementing the number without a noticeable animation (just update text). - Optionally, you could animate the number changing via a flip or fade, but not necessary. - Focus/Active State Indications: For list items or other tap highlights that aren’t persistent, an opacity change or background color flash is sufficient. iOS typically does a gray highlight that fades out when releasing a list cell. Implement by setting the pressed style and then removing it on release with a slight delay (or let iOS do it by default if you use <a> tags — but in a PWA likely we handle ourselves). - prefers-reduced-motion: Respect users who prefer less motion: - In CSS/Angular, detect @media (prefers-reduced-motion) and turn off or simplify animations: - Set animation durations to 0ms or very short. - Avoid moving elements dramatically – perhaps just do instant state changes. - For example:
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {

- { transition: none !important; animation-duration: 0ms !important; }
  }
  This blunt approach ensures even our card transitions and such become instant. Or we can specifically disable the card slide and just replace content. - Also avoid things like parallax or large scrolling effects (we aren’t using those anyway). - Subtlety: All animations should be subtle enough that the user perceives them as smoothness, not as delays. Nothing should take so long that it slows the user down. When in doubt, err on the side of shorter duration.
  By following these motion guidelines, the app will feel snappy and native-like, giving users appropriate feedback (through micro animations) without being distracting. The transitions should reinforce the user’s actions (e.g., card moves out signals completion, new card in signals next task) in a way that’s easily understood.

4. Theming & Design Tokens
   To make implementation easier and ensure consistency, define a set of design tokens – named constants for colors, font sizes, spacing, etc. These can be implemented as CSS variables in the :root or as a Tailwind config if using Tailwind. Below is a proposed token list:
   Color Tokens: - --color-bg: #F3F4F6 – App page background. - --color-surface: #FFFFFF – Surface/card background. - --color-text: #111827 – Primary text color. - --color-text-muted: #6B7280 – Secondary text color. - --color-primary: #F59E0B – Primary accent (amber). - --color-primary-dark: #D97706 – Darker amber for hover/active. - --color-success: #10B981 – Success green. - --color-danger: #EF4444 – Danger red. - --color-border: #E5E7EB – Neutral light gray for borders/dividers (could also derive from bg tone). - (If planning dark mode, you would also add tokens for dark equivalents, but for now omitted.)
   Typography Tokens: - --font-family-base: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, sans-serif (system font stack). - --font-size-xl: 32px (large titles). - --font-size-lg: 22px (section headers). - --font-size-md: 18px (card titles / subtitles). - --font-size-base: 16px (body text). - --font-size-sm: 14px (secondary text). - --font-size-xs: 12px (caption). - --font-weight-regular: 400. - --font-weight-medium: 500. - --font-weight-semibold: 600. - --font-weight-bold: 700.
   Spacing (8px scale): - --spacing-1: 4px. - --spacing-2: 8px. - --spacing-3: 12px (we might use 12px sometimes, hence included). - --spacing-4: 16px. - --spacing-6: 24px. - --spacing-8: 32px. (You can continue if needed, but these cover our usage.)
   Sizing: - --size-min-tap: 44px (minimum tap target). - --size-button-height: 52px (preferred button height). - --radius-sm: 4px. - --radius-md: 8px. - --radius-lg: 12px (primary radius for cards/buttons). - --radius-pill: 9999px (full pill for things like toasts). - --shadow-card: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1) (card shadow small). - --shadow-modal: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.2) (if needed for larger overlays).
   Motion: - --duration-fast: 150ms. - --duration-base: 300ms. - --easing-standard: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1) (Material’s ease, but we can adjust). - --easing-ease-out: cubic-bezier(0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 1) or simply ease-out (iOS-like). - --easing-ease-in: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 1, 1).
   You can define these in CSS:
   :root {
   --color-bg: #F3F4F6;
   --color-surface: #FFFFFF;
   --color-text: #111827;
   --color-text-muted: #6B7280;
   --color-primary: #F59E0B;
   --color-primary-dark: #D97706;
   --color-success: #10B981;
   --color-danger: #EF4444;

   --font-family-base: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, sans-serif;
   --font-size-xl: 32px;
   --font-size-lg: 22px;
   --font-size-md: 18px;
   --font-size-base: 16px;
   --font-size-sm: 14px;
   --font-size-xs: 12px;
   --font-weight-regular: 400;
   --font-weight-medium: 500;
   --font-weight-semibold: 600;
   --font-weight-bold: 700;

   --spacing-1: 4px;
   --spacing-2: 8px;
   --spacing-3: 12px;
   --spacing-4: 16px;
   --spacing-6: 24px;
   --spacing-8: 32px;

   --radius-sm: 4px;
   --radius-md: 8px;
   --radius-lg: 12px;
   --radius-pill: 9999px;

   --shadow-card: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
   --shadow-modal: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);

   --duration-fast: 150ms;
   --duration-base: 300ms;
   --easing-standard: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1);
   --easing-ease-out: cubic-bezier(0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 1);
   }
   Then use these variables throughout your CSS:
   body {
   background: var(--color-bg);
   font-family: var(--font-family-base);
   color: var(--color-text);
   }
   .card {
   background: var(--color-surface);
   border-radius: var(--radius-lg);
   box-shadow: var(--shadow-card);
   padding: var(--spacing-4);
   }
   h1 {
   font-size: var(--font-size-xl);
   font-weight: var(--font-weight-bold);
   }
   .text-muted {
   color: var(--color-text-muted);
   }
   .btn-primary {
   background: var(--color-primary);
   transition: background var(--duration-fast) var(--easing-ease-out);
   }
   .btn-primary:hover { background: var(--color-primary-dark); }
   If using Tailwind CSS, you could incorporate these as your theme (e.g., define the colors palette with those hex values, set borderRadius values to 12px, etc., and fontFamily to system). But given an Angular PWA, you might prefer straightforward CSS or SCSS with variables for easier control.
   The key is that by having tokens, you can easily adjust things in one place (for example, if the primary color needs to change, or if you find 18px text is too large and want to drop to 17px, one change updates all usage).
   Also, tokens like colors and spacing make it easier to support dark mode later by swapping :root values (or using @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) to override them).
   Finally, using tokens improves maintainability – you can ensure consistency (no accidental off-brand colors or inconsistent spacing) since you’ll be reusing the same CSS variables.

5. Logo & App Icon Usage
   The app’s branding includes a white logo (transparent background). We need to integrate this logo in a way that maintains visibility and aligns with our color scheme.
   PWA Icon (Home Screen icon)
   For the home screen and iOS app icon: - Background Color: Since the logo is white, use a solid background that provides contrast. A good choice is our primary amber (#F59E0B) or a slight variation (perhaps a bit darker or more saturated so white stands out). This gives a friendly, warm vibe and ties into the app’s theme (eggs, farm, sunshine). - Icon Composition: iOS icons are rounded squares (180px with corner radius ~20% of size, or use 1024px art with Apple’s mask). Place the logo centered, and sized with padding around it. Typically, leave about 10-15% margin on each side. - If the logo itself is not square, you might place it so it fills most of the width or height while keeping equal margins. - If there’s text in the logo, consider removing it for the icon (small text won’t be readable). Perhaps the logo is an image/symbol that can stand alone. - No need for extra ornamentation: The icon can just be the white logo on the amber background. This keeps it simple and recognizable. - Ensure to generate the various sizes (we might not detail here, but iOS uses 180x180 for home screen, etc. The important part is design). - Splash screen background: You can use the same amber or a neutral white for the splash screen background if iOS shows one when launching.
   In-App Usage (Header & Branding)
   • Header Logo: If you choose to include the logo in the app header, do one of two things:
   • Place the white logo on a solid color background within the header. For example, have a small squared area or circle behind the logo in the primary color (or another contrasting color). This essentially makes it like an icon in the header. The rest of the header could be white or that same color.
   o E.g., a circular badge of amber with the white logo on it, next to the title text. This could be ~32px circle with logo inside.
   • Use a dark header background so that the white logo can sit directly on it. A dark charcoal (#111827) or a colored variant could be used for the header bar while the logo is placed. However, a dark header might conflict with the otherwise light design of the app – likely not preferred unless we want a strong top bar.
   • Given our palette, using the primary amber in the header might be a bit intense if it’s a large area. You could consider a softer variant (maybe a lighter golden, like #FDE68A which is Amber 300) for a more subtle background with the white logo on it. But then the white logo might not pop on a light color.
   • Possibly the simplest: have a small colored icon version of the logo in the header on white. For example, the nonprofit might have a variant of the logo (like a colored version). If not, you could put the white logo on a small colored square. But white on white is a no-go, so it needs some backing color.
   • Home Screen Display: On the Home/Dashboard screen, consider displaying the logo and app name prominently at the top (almost like a welcome). Perhaps a small logo above or next to a large title “Biruk’s Egg Project Deliveries”. This could be centered on the home screen if not using a nav bar, or left-aligned with a large title.
   • Login/Loading (if any): If the app had a loading screen or something, a centered logo on a brand background can be shown.
   Complementary Backgrounds
   • Theme Relation: The egg/farm theme suggests warm, earthy colors. Our primary amber covers the “yolk” idea. We might introduce a secondary color if needed for backgrounds:
   • Perhaps a soft yellow or cream as a background in some places to subtly bring in the theme (like #FEFCE8, a very light yellow). Could be used for a special highlight or empty state background.
   • A muted green could also tie in (for success states and the idea of farm/organics), but sparingly (we have green for success anyway).
   • In general, avoid too many background colors – the app should mostly use white and light gray to stay calm. Use the accent colors for emphasis only.
   • Legibility: Ensure that wherever the white logo is used, the background behind it has enough contrast. White on bright amber is good. White on dark gray is also good. White on light gray or white is not (so avoid placing the logo directly on the light page background).
   • Favicons/Android Icon: For completeness, you might also create an icon for Android (they like transparent backgrounds or adaptive icons). Possibly just use the same composition.
   In summary, use the primary color as the brand background for the logo in most cases. The app icon and any in-app references to the logo should leverage that color or other sufficiently dark colors to let the white logo shine. Keep the logo usage minimal within the app interface so as not to clutter; the user knows the app they opened – so a little branding (like an icon in the header or a launch screen) goes a long way.
6. Example Layouts for Key Screens
Let’s apply the above guidelines to three critical screens, describing layout, approximate measurements, and styling in context.
6.1 Home / Dashboard Screen
Purpose: Entry point for the app where the user can import data, select the delivery week, see summary stats, and start the route.
Layout Structure: - Header: If using a standalone welcome header, could be a block with logo+title. Otherwise, if a nav bar is present, it might already show “Deliveries”. - For this example, we’ll assume a simple large title instead of a persistent nav bar on home: - Top margin ~ safe area (44px) + 16px. - The app logo icon (small) could appear here or just omit it for simplicity. - A large title text “Deliveries” in 32px Bold, left-aligned, 16px side padding. - Week Selector: Immediately below title, a toggle for Week A / Week B. - Implement as a segmented control: - Width: maybe 200px total (100px each segment) or stretch to fit content. - Height: 36-44px (make sure it’s tap-friendly). - Use a container with light border radius (999px for pill shape). Background light gray (#E5E7EB). - Inside, two option buttons. “Week A” and “Week B” text 14px medium. - Active one: background amber, white text. Inactive: transparent background, text color #111 (or amber for a flip, but usually iOS segmented text uses system blue or so; we can use our amber for active, dark text for inactive). - This control can be centered horizontally or left-aligned under the title (centering might look nice for a toggler). - Margin-top: 16px under the title. - Route Summary Card: A small card or info panel showing stats from the imported route. - Could be a full-width card with a subtle background (maybe a slightly different tone of gray or just white with border). - Padding: 12px. - Content: Could list: - “Total stops: X” - “Delivered: Y” - “Skipped: Z” - Possibly arranged in columns or rows. For simplicity, three lines or a single line separated by bullet dots. - Style text: 16px, maybe medium for numbers. - If using a card, ensure it’s visually distinct (you could use a light yellow background here to highlight it, or just rely on border). - This element can be relatively small. Maybe margin-top 16px after week selector. - Import CSV Button: If the user hasn’t imported data or wants to update: - Provide a button “Import CSV” (secondary style). - Place it above or below the summary? Possibly above the summary if no data yet (with a prompt). - Could also integrate it as “If no route loaded, show a big import prompt; if route exists, show summary.” - Let’s say route exists: We might still have the button but deemphasized. - For layout, perhaps put “Import CSV” as a small outlined button in the top right area of the summary or title bar. - Alternatively, have a dedicated section at bottom: e.g., below everything, “Import a new delivery list” with the button. - Keep it obvious but not primary – user will use it occasionally. - Backup Now & Last Backup: - Possibly a small text at bottom of screen or below summary: “Last backup: <time>” with a button next to it “Backup now”. - Could be a small row: - Use muted text for “Last backup: 2 days ago”. - A small secondary button “Backup now” next to it. - If space is narrow, this might wrap: could do backup as an icon + text button. - Alternatively, show the last backup in smaller font under the Backup button. - Alignment: maybe left-align both in a card or just flush to sides of screen padding. - Style: backup button could be tertiary (text-only underlined?) or secondary (outlined). As backup is not destructive or primary, an outline is fine. - Start Route CTA: The primary call to action on this screen. - A big Primary button labeled “Start Route” at the bottom (or mid-screen if content is sparse). - Full width, margin-top 24px from previous content. - If route data isn’t loaded yet, this button might be disabled or hidden (since you can’t start). In that case, emphasize importing instead. - When enabled, this button takes the user to the Route Planner or directly into Delivery mode depending on flow.
Hierarchy & Visual Flow: Upon opening the app, user sees large title (app context), immediately sees which week is active (and can toggle), then sees summary info confirming data, then the big Start button to go. Secondary actions (import, backup) are present but not more prominent than Start.
Measurements & Spacing (approx): - Top safe area: 44px. - Title block: 40px tall text, plus 16px margin bottom. - Week toggle: 40px tall, width auto (maybe 120px total), centered under title, 16px margin bottom. - Summary card: full width minus padding (16px each side), height depends on content, perhaps 80px tall. margin-top 16px. - Start button: 52px tall, full width, amber. margin-top 24px. - Backup info: maybe appears below Start as a smaller text and button. Or if it’s a persistent UI element, possibly put it in the footer area of home.
We can present a snippet of how the HTML might look:
<main class="home-screen">
  <h1 class="page-title">Deliveries</h1>
  <div class="week-toggle">
    <button class="segmented active">Week A</button>
    <button class="segmented">Week B</button>
  </div>
  <div class="route-summary card">
    <p>Total stops: 12</p>
    <p>Delivered: 0 &bull; Skipped: 0</p>
  </div>
  <button class="btn-primary start-route">Start Route</button>
  <div class="backup-row">
    <span class="text-muted">Last backup: 3 days ago</span>
    <button class="btn-text backup-btn">Backup now</button>
  </div>
</main>
With corresponding styles following our guide:
.page-title { font-size: 32px; font-weight: bold; margin: 60px 0 16px 16px; }
.week-toggle { display: flex; margin: 0 16px 16px; background: #E5E7EB; border-radius: 999px; }
.week-toggle .segmented { flex: 1; padding: 8px; font-size: 14px; border: none; border-radius: 999px; }
.week-toggle .active { background: #F59E0B; color: #FFF; }
.route-summary { margin: 0 16px 16px; padding: 12px; border-radius: 12px; background: #FFF; box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);}
.start-route { margin: 8px 16px 16px; }
.backup-row { margin: 8px 16px 0; display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center; }
(This is an illustration; actual spacing might adjust once visually tested.)
6.2 Route Planner Screen
Purpose: Allows viewing and potentially reordering all stops before (or after) starting the delivery run.
Layout Structure: - Header/Navigation: If using a typical nav pattern, this screen would have a back arrow to Home plus title "Route Plan" or similar in the header bar. For example, an app-header with “Route Planner” centered, and a back button on left. - Title font: 17-22px Semibold (since likely a normal navbar style, not large title here). - The header bar height ~56px + safe area, with perhaps a bottom border line. - Sort/Actions Bar: Just below header (or as part of it), one could include a sort option: - e.g., a small horizontal menu: “Sort by: [City ▼]” indicating current sort key. Clicking could drop a small menu. To keep it simple, could skip advanced controls if not needed. The user might be fine with default order or manual reorder only. - If included, style it as a text or small button. Align it to right of the screen or as a center segment. Not critical. - List of Stops: The main content is the vertical list of stops. We’ll represent it as multiple “route-item” rows inside a scrollable container. - The container should have padding: e.g., 16px top (to not clash with header) and 16px bottom (to allow scrolling past last item a bit). - Each item: - Background: white. - Margin-bottom: 8px (except last). - Padding: 12px 16px. - Corner: 8px (slightly smaller rounding for a tighter list). - Shadow: maybe none, use flat list with separation via margin and maybe a subtle border-bottom if needed. Or a tiny shadow if we want each like a “card snippet”. - Content layout: - Left: Stop name (maybe with city inline). - Right: Dozens or status. - If editing or reordering, also an icon on one side. - We can do <div class="route-item"><div><div class="stop-name">Alice’s Diner</div><div class="stop-city">Sioux Falls, SD</div></div><div class="stop-count">5 dz</div></div> as structure. - For visual separation, could give each item an alternating slight tint (probably not necessary, margins suffice). - Reorder handles: If the plan is to allow reordering: - Possibly only enable it in an "edit mode". If always enabled, it might conflict with scrolling. - But maybe user will reorder rarely, so a long-press on an item could allow drag. - In design terms, we include a handle icon (⁞⁞) on the right of each item. It's visible but maybe at 50% opacity so as not to distract. - The handle area should still be within the 44px padding so it’s not too far at edge. - Status Indication: If this list is being viewed after some deliveries done: - Delivered stops: you could gray them out or add a checkmark. For example, delivered stops’ text could become gray and their checkmark icon shown. - But that may not be needed if this list is primarily for planning before starting. - The user will tap “Start route” on previous screen to actually go to the run. Alternatively, maybe tapping a stop here could start from that stop (like jump in sequence) – depends on features. - Footer: Not a fixed footer here, just scroll. However, after planning, user might hit Start from here too. If so, maybe a persistent “Begin Delivery” button at bottom of list. But since we had Start on home, perhaps route planner is read-only unless user chooses to reorder.
Measurements: - Header height 56 (plus safe area). - List item height ~60px (assuming two lines of text inside). - If 12 stops, total content height ~ (60+8)*12 = ~816px, which is scrollable. - Padding around list items ensures comfortable touch.
Styling Recap for list item: - Stop Name: 16px Medium, color #111. - City: 14px Regular, color muted (#6B7280). - Quantity: 16px Medium, color #111 (or could color-code if we want like green if delivered, amber if pending, etc). - If status icon: maybe 16px icon either before name or after quantity.
Example markup:
<header class="app-header">
  <button class="back-btn">←</button>
  <h2 class="header-title">Route Planner</h2>
  <!-- maybe sort button here -->
</header>
<main class="route-planner-screen">
  <div class="stop-list">
    <div class="route-item">
      <div class="stop-info">
        <div class="stop-name">Alice’s Diner</div>
        <div class="stop-city text-muted">Sioux Falls, SD</div>
      </div>
      <div class="stop-meta">
        <span class="stop-count">5&nbsp;dz</span>
        <span class="drag-handle">⁞⁞</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <!-- Repeat for each stop -->
  </div>
</main>
CSS snippet:
.route-item { display: flex; justify-content: space-between; background: #FFF; border-radius: 8px; padding: 12px 16px; margin-bottom: 8px; align-items: center; }
.stop-info .stop-name { font-size: 16px; font-weight: 500; }
.stop-info .stop-city { font-size: 14px; color: #6B7280; }
.stop-meta { display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 12px; }
.stop-count { font-size: 16px; font-weight: 500; }
.drag-handle { font-size: 18px; color: #9CA3AF; cursor: grab; }
.route-item:active { background: #F3F4F6; } /* highlight on tap */
(This provides a baseline style. The drag-handle can change cursor on desktop, and on touch devices, it’s just a touch target.)
6.3 Delivery Run Screen (Stop Card view)
Purpose: Core screen used during deliveries, focusing on one stop at a time with Deliver/Skip actions.
Layout Structure: - Header: Possibly minimal here. We might omit a traditional header to maximize space. Instead, integrate a few key elements at top of the content: - A back button to exit/cancel the run if needed (maybe a small “< Back” in top left; though user could also force-close app – better to have an explicit way out). - The route name or week could be in small text at top center just for context (“Week A”). - Alternatively, the header can be hidden and use swipe-right gesture to go back. But explicit is safer for our user demographic. - If space is needed, a small top bar of ~44px could hold a back arrow and maybe the app name or an icon for context. - Progress Indicator: Right below header (or at top if no header). Show “Stop X of N” in a small font. - For example, a 14px text, centered or aligned to card, and the progress bar underneath as described. - Could also place “Stop X of N” in the top-left of the card content area, and the progress bar either just below it or at bottom of card header. - Delivery Card: The focus element, centered vertically if possible (with some top margin to avoid going under any notch, and bottom margin to avoid clash with bottom bar). - It may actually occupy most of the screen naturally, depending on info length. - Content inside: - Stop name – 18px Semibold, maybe allow 2 lines if long. - Address – 16px Regular or 15px, possibly two lines (street, and city). - Quantity – a large text. One design: put “5 dozen” as a large number. - Could style it as 5 in 40px font and dozen in 18px, to really emphasize the number. But that might be overkill, simpler is just “5 dozen” in, say, 20px Bold. - Place this either below address or maybe above if you want it prominent. Perhaps below name and address, as a concluding piece of info (like "What to deliver: 5 dozen"). - Notes – if present. Could be shown in a small italic or just smaller text block at bottom: e.g., “Note: leave at front desk.” Style it in muted color. - Potentially a small link or action if the user needs directions – maybe not needed if they know their route well or if they have poor service (maybe they won't use a map). - But optionally, a small map icon or address link that opens Apple Maps could be included next to address. - The card content should be stacked with comfortable spacing: - Maybe 8px between title and address, 8px between address and quantity, 8px between quantity and notes. - Keep inner padding 16px as we set. - Example content layout:
Stop 3 of 10         (small top label, could even be above card as separate)
[Progress bar]

Bob's Grocery
123 Elm St, Springfield, SD 57055

4 dozen

(Note: Deliver to side door)
Each section appropriately styled. - Bottom Action Bar: As described, containing Deliver (primary) and Skip (secondary) buttons. - They likely span side by side. Label text large enough (maybe use text-transform: uppercase if it helps recognition, but uppercase can be harder to read; maybe stick to normal case). - Color: Deliver (amber), Skip (white outline or gray background if we decided to differentiate from global secondary). - The bar itself might be white translucent. But the buttons with their colors will still be distinct blocks. - Provide a little gap between them (8px). - Ensure the bottom bar has padding bottom for safe area and the buttons don’t stretch into the curved corners area (their container can have margin bottom equal to safe inset). - Interactions on this screen: - Tapping Deliver triggers the progress to advance (and likely moves to next stop card with an animation). - Tapping Skip does similar (maybe logs skip status somewhere). - Possibly allow swiping the card left/right as alternative to deliver/skip (if you implement that, ensure an undo if accidental). - The back arrow in header if present should confirm if they really want to exit run (maybe a prompt). - Reachability: The main concern is ease of use in one hand. By placing the big buttons at bottom, that’s achieved. The content above might often be glanced at. If the stop name is very long or content tall, it might push the buttons down to the very bottom (which is fine, as they are fixed). - On smaller iPhones (SE), test that the card content + bottom bar fit without overflow. If not, the content area could scroll slightly.
Measurements: - Possibly set a max-height for the card content area if needed (like if notes are long, the card can scroll internally or the whole screen scrolls). - Buttons: each roughly ~calc(50% - 12px) width on a 375px screen (16px side padding in container, 8px gap, etc). - If screen height ~667px (iPhone 8), subtract header (~88 including safe), bottom bar (~80 including safe), leaves ~499px for content. More than enough for a typical address and such (which might be ~150-200px of vertical content). - So things should fit.
Example markup:

<header class="run-header">
  <button class="back-btn">Back</button>
  <div class="route-label text-muted">Week A Route</div>
</header>
<main class="delivery-run-screen">
  <div class="progress-section">
    <span class="stop-count-label">Stop 3 of 10</span>
    <div class="progress-bar-bg">
      <div class="progress-bar-fill" style="width: 30%;"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="delivery-card card">
    <h2 class="stop-name">Bob's Grocery</h2>
    <p class="stop-address">123 Elm St<br>Springfield, SD 57055</p>
    <p class="stop-quantity"><strong>4</strong> dozen</p>
    <p class="stop-notes text-muted">Note: Leave at front desk if no answer.</p>
  </div>
</main>
<div class="bottom-bar">
  <button class="btn-primary">Deliver</button>
  <button class="btn-secondary">Skip</button>
</div>
CSS snippet:
.stop-count-label { font-size: 14px; color: #6B7280; margin: 8px 0; display: block; text-align: center; }
.progress-bar-bg { background: #E5E7EB; border-radius: 4px; height: 4px; width: 100%; }
.progress-bar-fill { background: #10B981; height: 4px; width: 30%; border-radius: 4px; }
.delivery-card { margin: 16px; /* give it some separation from edges */ }
.delivery-card .stop-name { font-size: 18px; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 4px; }
.delivery-card .stop-address { font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 8px; line-height: 1.4; }
.stop-address br { content: ""; margin: 0; } /* just to ensure line break works in styling if needed */
.delivery-card .stop-quantity { font-size: 20px; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 8px; }
.delivery-card .stop-notes { font-size: 14px; font-style: italic; color: #6B7280; }
.bottom-bar { /* as discussed earlier */ }
The actual visual spacing might be tweaked, but this provides a ballpark.
These example layouts demonstrate how components and styles coalesce in practice. Each screen feels coherent with the design system: ample whitespace, clear typography, touch-friendly controls, and an iOS-like structure (segmented control for Week, large navigation title on Home, list grouping, etc.).
7. iOS Native Feel Considerations
To truly make the PWA feel at home on iPhone, we’ve aligned with many native iOS design patterns throughout. Here’s a summary of those choices and additional recommendations to maintain the native feel:
•	System Font & Text Style: By using the iOS system font and sizing similar to Apple’s guidelines (e.g., 17px body text, large 34px titles)[2], the app’s typography immediately feels familiar. This also benefits from iOS text rendering and Dynamic Type if a user has adjusted font sizes (Safari will respect some adjustments especially if we use -apple-system fonts).
•	Safe Areas & Layout Margins: We incorporate safe area insets on headers and footers, just as native apps do, ensuring no content is awkwardly positioned under notches[1]. We also use a consistent margin/padding (16px, roughly the standard in many iOS apps for side padding) so content isn’t edge-to-edge. Native apps often have layout margins of 16 points on iPhone, which we mirrored.
•	Large Titles & Hierarchy: The use of a large title on the Home screen replicates the UINavigationController large title style introduced in iOS 11[10]. It gives a friendly, native feel on the main screen. We then use normal titles on subsequent screens. This visual hierarchy (big title, then normal titles as you drill down) matches iOS convention and subconsciously tells users how screens are structured.
•	Blurred Translucent Bars: iOS is known for its frosted glass translucency in tab bars and nav bars. We suggest using backdrop-filter: blur() on the bottom action bar (and optionally the header) to mimic this effect. It’s a subtle cue that this element is like a native tab bar. (Be mindful that heavy blur can hurt performance on older iPhones, so test and possibly use a lower blur radius or disable if janky).
•	Minimalist Iconography: We avoid any iconography that screams non-iOS. For example, Material Design’s filled icons or Android’s hamburger menu icon could clash. We stick to simple line icons or iOS-like symbols. Also, we’ve not included any floating action buttons (FABs) or persistent on-screen buttons that aren’t typical in iOS. The primary action is in a toolbar at bottom, which is exactly how iOS might place a prominent action (like the Safari bottom bar).
•	No Ripples, Use Touch Highlight: On Android/Material, taps often show a ripple effect. On iOS, taps highlight content with a brief opacity change. We use CSS :active to create a similar effect (e.g., list item turns light gray on tap). No ripple animations that expand, which would feel out of place.
•	Gesture Support: iOS users expect to swipe back. In a PWA, you don’t get that automatically, but if using Angular, consider enabling swipe-back on the router (some libraries or custom code can do this) or at least ensure the user can use the Safari-edge-swipe to go back if the PWA has multiple pages (when not in standalone mode). Since it’s standalone, implementing a back button is important. We did that.
•	Haptics (if possible): Native iOS apps often give slight vibrations on certain actions (like a success or a long-press drag). The web can use the Vibration API (navigator.vibrate) for some feedback on events. For example, a short vibration when a delivery is marked could add a tactile feel. This is extra credit; not necessary, but an idea to enhance native feel.
•	Loading Indicators & Page Transitions: Use the CSS cursor or a custom overlay to simulate the instantaneous feel of native navigation. Angular might default to immediate content switch. If a delay occurs (loading something), a native app would show a spinner or at least not just freeze. We should handle loading states (even a half-second delay) with spinners or skeleton screens if needed to avoid feeling like a web page waiting.
•	Avoid Scroll Bounce issues: iOS has a rubber-band bounce on scroll. That’s fine for content. But for the main app container, ensure no double scrollable region that causes weird bounces. For instance, avoid having body scroll and also an inner div scroll both at full height. Typically, use body as the scroll container (unless you use some fancy internal scrolling). This prevents unnatural scrolling behavior that could tip off “this is a webpage”.
•	Disable Selection and Adjust Highlight: We can apply -webkit-user-select: none on non-input elements to prevent the tap-and-hold selection magnifying glass, which doesn’t happen in native apps unless it’s text editing. Also, consider setting -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0,0,0,0) to remove the blue highlight around taps by Safari[12]. Instead, we provide our custom feedback. This makes taps feel more app-like (no blue flash).
•	Orientation and Screen Changes: Lock orientation to portrait if possible (most native apps for such tasks do). Or at least test in landscape so nothing looks broken (particularly the bottom bar).
•	Follow Human Interface Guidelines: In summary, we’ve aligned with key points from Apple’s HIG for iOS:
•	Use touch target minimums[9].
•	Use system fonts and standard text sizes[4].
•	Use concise, easy-to-understand labels (the app uses plain language like “Deliver” instead of something jargon-y).
•	Use color sparingly for emphasis (we have basically one main accent color).
•	Ensure accessibility (high contrast, readable fonts, respect reduced motion).
•	And importantly, focus on content over chrome: the design is content-first (deliveries info and actions) with as little extra UI as needed (no decorative images or excessive branding in the way).
By minding these details, the PWA will avoid feeling like a generic web page and instead give the impression of a polished, platform-appropriate mobile app. Users often can’t tell the difference if these guidelines are followed well – they’ll just use it naturally.
8. Implementation Notes (CSS & Angular Integration)
Finally, a few practical tips to implement this design system in an Angular PWA:
•	Global Styles vs. Component Styles: Many of these styles (colors, typography, resets like tap highlight) should be in global styles (e.g., styles.scss in Angular) so they apply app-wide. Use the :root for CSS variables as shown, and apply base styles to body, etc.
•	Angular Material or Ionic?: If you’re using plain Angular without a UI library, you’ll be writing these styles from scratch, which is fine. If you were using a library like Ionic, many iOS styles are built-in. But here we assume custom implementation.
•	Using Tailwind: If comfortable, Tailwind could speed up applying these styles. For example, set theme colors to the ones above, borderRadius to 12px, etc. Then use classes like text-gray-900, bg-amber-500, rounded-xl, p-4, etc. Tailwind has an ios-align plugin for safe area but you can also just add padding manually.
•	If not using Tailwind, consider BEM naming or simple utility classes. For clarity, creating classes like .text-muted, .btn-primary as we described is one approach.
•	Safe Area in CSS: In Angular, ensure <meta name="viewport" content="viewport-fit=cover"> is in the HTML head to allow the app to extend under the notch and use env(safe-area-inset-*). Without that meta, the safe-area variables might not apply properly.
•	Asset management: Include the logo assets in the PWA manifest for the icon. Also create an SVG or PNG of the white logo on amber background for the icon of appropriate sizes.
•	Testing: Test on an actual iPhone if possible (or the Safari responsive simulator) to see default behaviors:
•	E.g., Safari might by default apply some styling to <input> or <button> that we might override.
•	Also test the PWA installed (standalone mode) to ensure the styling is consistent there (sometimes differences in standalone).
•	Dark Mode (Future): Perhaps not needed now, but you can plan by using those CSS variables. For example:
 	@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --color-bg: #1C1C1E;
    --color-surface: #2C2C2E;
    --color-text: #F5F5F7;
    --color-text-muted: #9A9A9D;
    /* and adjust others accordingly, e.g., amber might need tweaking to appear slightly muted on dark. */
  }
}
 	iOS will automatically pick up if you add meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark". We saw an example snippet in that blog[13] which sets color-scheme: light dark; to allow automatic form control theming. It’s a nice touch if you do decide to support dark mode down the line.
•	Performance: Our design is lightweight. Just ensure to use modern CSS (Flexbox for layout, etc.) and avoid heavy shadows or filters except where needed. The blur we use is acceptable in small areas (nav, footer). If performance suffers, it can be dropped.
•	Angular Specific: Use Angular’s binding to dynamically add classes for state (e.g., [ngClass]="{ 'is-active': condition }" for toggles or active states). For animations, Angular’s animation library could implement the page transitions or use CSS as described with simple classes toggling.
•	Forms and Inputs: Angular forms will likely be used for any inputs (like file upload). Just make sure to style those elements as per guide (maybe via global input, select, button { font-family: ...; } so that they default to system font, etc.).
•	Icon Components: Perhaps use an icon font or an SVG library for the few icons (heroicons can be installed and used as SVG). Or include inline SVGs for the few needed images (like a checkmark or arrow).
•	Offline considerations: Since it’s offline-first, ensure the UI indicates when a backup is done or pending. Perhaps use a different state on backup button if offline or last backup failed (like color it red if not done recently? Up to you).
•	Quality Assurance: Check that all text is readable with the chosen colors in bright daylight (maybe test by enabling Light mode full brightness). Also, have someone not familiar with app test the labeling – e.g., does “Skip” clearly mean “will do later” to them? Sometimes wording can be tweaked (maybe “Skip Stop” if needed for clarity).
By following this guide and implementing carefully, you should achieve a cohesive look that is user-friendly, accessible, and platform-consistent. The end result will be an Angular PWA that your aunt can use intuitively, even with spotty connectivity, and it will feel like a natural extension of her iPhone – simple, reliable, and pleasant to use.
